Subject: Request for Department Change

Hi T, Remyah Devi,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to formally request a change of department from "DE EE Platform DXP" to "Digital Learning". Having worked in "DE EE Platform DXP" for 2.3 years, I have gained valuable experience and skills that I believe will translate well to the "Digital Learning".

The reason for my request is I got an opportunity on Digital learning department in Google DSCC Manila requirement | LMS Admin role on skill of LMS. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in DE EE Platform DXP", and I am looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow professionally.

I would be grateful if we could approve my request on department change. I am looking forward to your guidance and feedback on this matter.

Thank you for considering my request. I am eager to contribute to the "Digital Learning" and continue to deliver results for the company.

Thanks & Regards,
